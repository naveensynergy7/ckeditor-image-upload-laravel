# LARAVEL CKEDITOR WITH IMAGE UPLOAD

This repo contains the CKEditor library for Laravel where I added most of the required tools for the WYSWYG editor and removed unnecessary toolbars.

## Usage

Get all code from create-post.blade.php file for the Ckeditor customized tools
and CKEditor library is in public folder

```bash
1. public/CKEditor - for library
2. create-post.blade.php -  for code initialization and views code
```
